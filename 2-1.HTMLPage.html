            Signs that fraught relations between Canada and India were heading
            further south became clear during the G-20 summit in New Delhi
            earlier this month, when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau,
            unlike other Western leaders, did not hold formal bilateral talks
            with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Instead, the two leaders
            raised serious concerns with each other on the sidelines of the
            summit, where Modi brought up “continuing anti-India activities of
            extremist elements in Canada,” according to his office. Experts say
            India-Canada ties—historically driven by trade and the presence of a
            large Indian diaspora in Canada—have slowly deteriorated in recent
            years over claims from India that Canada has fostered sympathy
            toward a Sikh separatist movement, and counter-claims from Canada
            accusing Indian officials of interfering in its domestic politics.

            That relationship hit rock bottom on Monday when Trudeau made an
            explosive statement before the Canadian Parliament that Ottawa was
            pursuing “credible allegations” from Canadian intelligence against
            New Delhi for playing a role in the assassination of a prominent
            Sikh Canadian leader, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, on Canadian soil in
            June. The Canadian government expelled a senior Indian diplomat
            shortly after Trudeau’s comments; India swiftly retaliated by
            issuing a statement Tuesday that denied any involvement in Nijjar’s
            death and expelled an unnamed senior Canadian diplomat.
