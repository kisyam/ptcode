            Tensions among Indian and Canadian officials first simmered in 2015,
            when Trudeau came into power and appointed four Sikh ministers to
            his then 30-member cabinet. In the past, Indian diplomats have also
            raised issues over Sikh Canadians who express support for the
            Khalistan movement, which calls for a separatist Sikh homeland in
            India. One Hindu temple in Canada was vandalized last year with
            graffiti that read “death to India” in Urdu and “Khalistan,” and
            Sikh Canadians have organized local referendums over Sikh
            independence from India.
