            In 2018, Trudeau’s trip to India was criticized when his delegation,
            which included a Sikh contingent, met Jaspal Atwal, a Sikh man
            convicted of the attempted murder of a visiting Indian cabinet
            minister. (Canada later rescinded Atwal’s invitation to a dinner
            reception in New Delhi.) But these issues appeared to have taken a
            backseat when the two countries began to boost ties to counter
            Beijing. <br /><br />Until recent months, India-Canada relations
            were in a relatively good place, says Kugelman. “Commercial ties
            were robust and strategic convergences, especially shared concerns
            about China, were strengthening cooperation,” he says. Seeking to
            diversify the Canadian economy, Trudeau saw India as a critical
            partner under its Indo-Pacific strategy, given the country’s growing
            economic and demographic importance in the region. As recently as
            May, both sides appeared optimistic that an early-progress trade
            agreement on automobiles, agriculture, and information technology
            would be signed.<br /><br />
            How have India-Canada relations deteriorated in recent months? In
            early June, India’s Minister of External Affairs, S. Jaishankar,
            warned during a press conference that Canada giving space to Sikh
            separatists “was not good for the relationship” between the two
            countries. <br /><br />The comments came in response to a question
            over a social media clip of a parade held by Khalistani separatists
            in Brampton, Ontario, on June 4. “For us, how Canada has dealt with
            the Khalistani issue has been a long-standing concern because, very
            frankly, they seem to be driven by vote-bank politics,” Jaishankar
            said, a reference to Sikh Canadians, who form a plurality of Indian
            Canadian voters.
