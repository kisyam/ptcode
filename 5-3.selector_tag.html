        <h1>Jessica Knoll Wants to Correct the Record on Ted Bundy</h1>
        <h2>
            Jessica Knoll is preparing to publish her latest novel, Bright Young
            Women.

            Success doesn’t look the same for novelist Jessica Knoll as it did
            five years ago. In 2018, the Luckiest Girl Alive author raised both
            cheers and eyebrows when she wrote an op-ed for the New York Times
            titled, “I Want to Be Rich and I’m Not Sorry.” That type of ambition
            may be the norm in finance or law, but in book publishing, where
            fiscal prosperity is elusive, artistic integrity is usually the
            professed goal.

            “Can we just say the quiet part out loud?” Knoll, 39, asks over a
            matcha latte at New York City’s ModernHaus hotel. “Women want to be
            financially successful but also love what they do. It’s perfectly
            possible for these two things to coexist.” She knows writers are
            expected to be “precious” about their art. “I’ve been passionate
            about writing since I could hold a pen. But there’s a world where
            men make a lot of money doing this.” Knoll would like to profit too.
